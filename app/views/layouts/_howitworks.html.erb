			<h2> Recursive incentive, do more with less</h2>
			<p>  You need people's goodwill to spread the message. Put a reward will get you more attention and engage people who is otherwise reluctant to participate. </p>
			<p> With bullhorn, you can turbo boost your search network. You can expect five times more participation with same amount of monetary reward.</p>
			<p> Say you put a reward of $500. If Charlie help to send the request to John, and John twitted it to his friend Roland and luckily Roland found what you were looking for! Bullhorn allows you to reward Roland $250, John $125 and Charlie $$62.5 </p>
			<p> So everybody has an incentive to keep an eye for you, and at the same time relay your message along.</p>
